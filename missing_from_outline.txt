Need:

something to log a unique kill
 - DONE: loaddb.py does this when reading milestones.
 
something to see if other people have killed all the uniques, and if so how many (there are 34)
 - 

something to see if a specific unique is killed -- DONE: query.has_killed_unique
something to see if a player has gotten a rune yet -- DONE: query.player_count_runes

something to log a player getting a rune - DONE: automatic in loaddb.py

something to tell if it's my first all-rune win -- loaddb.count_wins() now takes an optional argument for "games with at least this many runes"

something to tell if this game is an all-rune win
 - [gs] If you have the game dictionary, d['urune'] == 15, no?

how many all-runers happened before this game? (by anyone, not just by me, can stop at 3) -- DONE: Use count_wins

how many wins have happened before this game? (by anyone, not just by me, can stop at 3)
how many wins do I have so far? -- DONE: loaddb.count_wins()

plus everything in update-page.py
